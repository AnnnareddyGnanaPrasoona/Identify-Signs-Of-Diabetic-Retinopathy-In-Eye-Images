# Identify-Signs-Of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-In-Eye-Images
### INTRODUCTION:
Diabetic retinopathy is an eye condition that can cause vision loss and blindness in
people who have diabetes. It affects blood vessels in the retina (the light - sensitive
layer of tissue in the back of your eye).Vision loss due to diabetic eye disease is on the
rise and is expected to reach epidemic proportions globally in the next few decades.

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) often remains undetected until it progresses to an advanced
vision  threatening stage. The current state of DR screening in the real world, based on
assessment of color fundus photographs (CFPs) by a retina specialist, leaves a large
proportion of patients undiagnosed and therefore receiving medical help too late.
Notwithstanding, early detectionand prevention of Dr progression are essential to
mitigate the rising threat of DR.

In this study, our aim is to identify retinopathy using different diabetic retinopathy . In
addition to the earlier studies of referable diabetic retinopathy classifcation system we
also present state-of-the-art results for the clinically used grade classification.
Moreover, we present what preprocessing and regularization steps to the images needs  
to be done for the good functionality of the deep learning system and investigate
systematically how the size with much smaller number of images used in training
affects its performance.

### EXISTING PROBLEM :

Diabetic retinopathy is an eye disease caused by diabetes that can lead to loss of vision
or even complete blindness. Diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of
blindness in the United States, and is the leading cause of blindness for people aged 20
to 64 years. Diabetic retinopathy is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. It is
caused by damage to the blood vessels of the light - sensitive tissue at the back of the
eye (retina). Millions of people suffer from diabetic retinopathy, the leading cause of
blindness among working aged adults.

### PROPOSED SOLUTION :

The main objective is to scale the efforts of lab technicians through technology to gain
the ability to automatically screen images for disease and provide information on how
severe the condition may be. This project is capable of classifying images based on
disease pathology from four severity levels. A convolutional neural network (CNN)
convolves an input image with a defined weight matrix to extract specific image
features without losing spatial arrangement information. There will be a web application
through which user can give their input image then they can check the predicted output
and this application is integrated with trained CNN model.

### STAGES OF DIABETIC RETINOPATHY :

#### There are four stages of diabetic retinopathy :
● Mild Nonproliferative Retinopathy – This is the earliest stage of diabetic
retinopathy, and it’s characterized by balloon-like swelling in the retina’s blood
vessels. These are called microaneurysms, and these vessels can leak into the
eye.

● Moderate Nonproliferative Retinopathy – During this stage, the blood vessels
nourishing the retina swell and may even become blocked. This can contribute to
diabetic macular edema (DME) which is a build-up of fluid in the macula region of
the retina.Because the macula is critical for sharp, clear vision, DME can cause
vision changes. In fact, DME is the most common reason people with diabetic
retinopathy experience vision loss. Although DME can occur at any stage of
diabetic retinopathy, itbecomes increasingly likely as diabetic retinopathy
worsens.

● Severe Nonproliferative Retinopathy – At this stage, an increasing number of
blood  vessels nourishing the eye have become blocked. As a result, the retina is
signaled to grow new blood vessels.

● Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR) – This is the final stage of diabetic
retinopathy. New blood vessels proliferate, growing inside the retina and into the
vitreous gel, which is the fluid that fills the eye. Because these blood vessels are
delicate, they may begin to leak and bleed. As a result, scar tissue may form,
causing retinal detachment, the pulling away of the retina from underlying tissue.
Retinal detachment may cause spotty vision, flashes of lights, or severe vision
loss
